# Paper Mario 64 JP Parity Patch

This repo is intended to be used with the StarRod modding tool (v. 5.3.0) by clover.

The patches provided aim to undo changes made from the JP to the US version of Paper Mario, with a focus on changes that alter both casual and glitched gameplay, such as during speedruns.
